					<p>I should say from the start that I live on Huntington blvd., so I may be susceptible to a bias in its favor.  But oh well.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Historic Huntington blvd. is a mile long, broad street lined with hundred year old trees and equally old houses.  A wide green strip runs down the middle, with regularly spaced street lights of antique appearance.  It is a popular location for joggers, dog walkers, bicyclists (and okay, I admit it, car thieves and people trying to escape from the police, but oh well.  Put a club on your steering wheel).</p>
					<br>
					<p>If you aren’t interested in jogging, walking your dog or bicycling (or stealing a car), you might want to come by for the annual mile-long yard sale in September.  The entire street blossoms into a festival of great deals, things to eat, and even musical entertainment.  If you miss that in September, stop by in December, when each street light is wreathed in a gold tinsel halo and adorned in red ribbons, and the tallest living, lighted, decorated Christmas tree stands in elegance in the front yard of one of Huntington’s largest homes.</p>
					<br>
					<p>We don’t live in one of Huntington Blvd.’s largest homes.  But that’s one of the nice things about the street.  Every house is different.  Tudor mansions stand next to humble bungalows.  And even the kids will pause to gaze at some of the gingerbread homes, and the dark foreboding castles.  Who knows what stories lurk within?</p>

					<p>So you’re pulling your hair out.  The kids don’t want to go to Oso de Oro.  They’re tired of it.  They just roll their eyes when you mention Woodward Park.  “Too much goose poop,” your son informs you.  But you have to take them somewhere.  You have to.  Going somewhere must happen very, very soon and you are racking your brains.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Take them to Fancher Creek.  If you live North of Shaw you are probably saying, “Fancher Creek?”  Yes, there are a few Fresno treasures South of Shaw.  Fancher Creek.  Pack some snacks, maybe a bird book, put on your walking shoes.  Tell the boys they can throw rocks at Fancher Creek.  As many as they want.  You’re all set.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Okay, Fancher Creek is actually, scientifically defined, an irrigation canal.  And in most places it just looks like an irrigation canal, with the cement sides and the overpasses that say “No Swimming” and perhaps a few choice words in graffiti.</p>
					<br>
					<p>But if you park right at the intersection of Butler and Del Mar, in the dirt patch where probably a few other people have already parked, and then head down the dirt path along this particular irrigation canal, you enter a magical realm.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Above you, very old trees spread their venerable branches.  A weeping willow trails it’s arms in the gently flowing water (well, if you go during irrigation season.  Otherwise, they trail their arms in the dwindling puddles).  The ground beneath your feet is carpeted in fragrant eucalyptus leaves and crunchy acorns.  You might see an opossum or a fox.  We have.  You will certainly see some ducks (did you bring bread crumbs?).</p>
					<br>
					<p>Along both sides of the creek/canal you get glimpses into the lovely back yards of Sunnyside residents, some of whom keep goats or chickens.  You are even likely to need to step aside as someone rides their horse past you.  They might stop and let the kids pet their steed if you ask nicely.</p>
					<br>
					<p>As the path curves away from Butler, you feel lost in a world of natural beauty.  No cars in sight.  No streets.  Plenty of rocks for the boys to throw into the water.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Watch your step for horse poop.  But other than that . . .</p>
