						<h3>Garden Store App</h3>

						<p>Libraries and bookstores have electronic catalogs. So why not garden stores and nurseries too? You could search for the store's inventory of plants at computer terminals in the store. Or you could search your smartphone on the way to the store or while browsing in the store. This app is the beginnings of such a catalog.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Uses <span>angularJS</span></li>
							<li>Includes multiple search filters</li>
							<li><span>Fully responsive</span></li>
							<li>Includes a <span>shopping cart</span> for quick pre-purchase calculations</li>
							<li>Features still being added</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Philosophy of Religion Website</h3>

						<p>Curious about philosophy of religion? Are you a professor looking for resources for your philosophy of religion class? Or a student looking to learn more about philosophy of religion? This site is for you. The first page of the site aims to peak curiosity and was fun to create. I am concerned about how it creates one more link for viewers to click to get to the main page. But I had such fun creating it that I have kept it for now. The website is still in its infancy, with many features still to come.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Uses some of my own <span>Javascript</span> and <span>jQuery</span> code</li>
							<li>Also uses <span>Bootstrap</span> and various plug-ins</li>
							<li>Will be <span>fully responsive</span> when finished</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Fresno Parenting Network</h3>

						<p>I created this site as a class project for the first in a series of courses in web development at <span>Geekwise Academy</span> in Fresno, California. This was my first attempt at creating a website. It looks good, I think. Its purpose is to help parents learn more about what Fresno has to offer families.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Includes <span>Drop-Down Menus</span></li>
							<li>Includes some <span>CSS Animations</span></li>
							<li>Includes a <span>contact form</span> which sends data to my email address</li>
							<li>Embeds maps</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>WeatherSmart Class Project</h3>

						<p>I developed this web page as a class project for the second in a series of courses in web development at <span>Geekwise Academy</span>. We were given a picture of what this webpage should look like. Then we had to re-create it on our own. I successfully created it so that it looks very much like the picture we were given. I also added gradients to make it look better. The web page is <span>fully responsive</span>. We were allowed and encouraged to use <span>Bootstrap</span> and <span>Pure CSS</span>. So I did. We also had to use <span>Photoshop</span> to extract an image of a woman from a background photo and touch the image up a bit. We also had to extract another smaller image from a background image. So this web page shows my ability to use Photoshop.</p>
